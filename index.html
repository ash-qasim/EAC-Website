                        Whether you know it or not everyone has a personal brand. Think of it as an aesthetic, the things you like
                        the things you do and the things you represent. It's the way you present yourself to society, it's essentially yourself
                        identity. But <em>why is it so important?</em>
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Well in this day and age of technological advancement it's common for recruiters to check out your social media, and no saying 
                        <small>"I don't have any social media..."</small> isn't going to work, especially if your username is MollyJefferson123. According to
                        a 
                        <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-half-of-employers-have-found-content-on-social-media-that-caused-them-not-to-hire-a-candidate-according-to-recent-careerbuilder-survey-300694437.html">
                            2018 CareerBuilder survey
                        </a>, 70% of employers use social media to find and screen canditates during the hiring process. Personal branding also allows
                        users represent their company in a good light, if you're an employee and you go to a conference and you network and build your personal brand,
                        your employer would be ecstatic since this is good business.

                    <p>
                        Now let's talk about that dreaded word we always hear about, <strong><span style="font-size: larger;">networking.</span></strong> Networking is extremely important for 
                        getting a job in Canada, or virtually everywhere. The job market is dilluted with top students from amazing schools with amazing grades, it's like a sea of perfection with 
                        no personality. Networking allows you to stand out from the crowd and make a name for yourself, and show your personality as well as display that you're not just a GPA or a name 
                        on a resume or candidate #438634 for a job.
